# Privacy Policy for YouTube Playlist Length
### Last Updated: 17-12-2025

YouTube Playlist Length ("we," "us," or "our") is dedicated to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension handles your information.

1. Data Collection and Usage We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII). The extension operates entirely client-side and only communicates with public APIs to perform its core function.

2. Permissions and Technical Data To function correctly, this extension requires the following permissions:

activeTab: We use this permission solely to read the URL of the current browser tab when you open the extension popup. This allows us to automatically detect if you are viewing a YouTube playlist or video and auto-fill the link for calculation. We do not store this URL or track your browsing history.

storage: This permission is requested to save your user preferences (such as the last used custom speed or API settings) locally on your device. No personal data is stored. (Note: While listed in the manifest, the current version operates without persistent storage, but this permission allows for future local preference saving.)

3. Third-Party Services

YouTube Data API: This extension uses the YouTube Data API to fetch public metadata about playlists and videos (such as video duration and title). By using this extension, you agree to be bound by the YouTube Terms of Service and Google Privacy Policy.

The extension sends the Playlist ID or Video ID you provide to YouTube's servers to retrieve duration data. It does not transmit your personal account information.

4. Data Retention We do not retain any user data. All calculations are performed instantly, and data is cleared once the extension popup is closed or the input is cleared.
